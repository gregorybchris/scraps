# Scraps

[Scrapscript](https://scrapscript.org/) is a programming language that aims to solve the software shareability problem. This repo contains a few example programs written in Scrapscript.

> Note: The Scrapscript language is still under active development and syntax may change. Code here has been tested with an early version of the [tekknolagi/scrapscript](https://github.com/tekknolagi/scrapscript) interpreter.

## Programs

- [bfs](bfs.scrap) - grid-based breadth-first search
- [hull](hull.scrap) - convex hull with the gift wrapping (Jarvis march) algorithm
